*   /bin            =>  important executable programs + core OS commands
*   in modern distro it's symbolically linked to /usr/bin

*   /boot           =>  files needed by the bootloader + initial ram files + kernel

*   /dev            =>  device files, dynamically created based on physical & virtual devices connected to the system

*   /etc            =>  critical configuration files and startup scripts

*   /home           =>  location of indevidual users home directories
*   /home/"username"    =>  contains configuration files specific to the user (.bashrc)

*   /lib            =>  shared libraries the system programs need
*   enable multiple programs to share code with each other
*   lib, lib32, lib64, libx32
*   symbolically linked to /usr/lib

*   /lost + /found  =>  chunks of broken files reside after a system crash

*   /media          =>  the mount point for filesystems stored on removable media
*   /media/"username"       =>  all connected removable media of the user

*   /mnt            =>  where you mount devices temporarily

*   /opt            =>  optional SW packages

#   pseudo filesystem       =>  created at startup and disappear at shutdown

*   /proc           =>  pseudo filesystem, info about every running process on the machine
*   contains a lot of info about the system
*   each active process has its own subdirectory

*   /root           =>  the home directory of the root user

*   /run            =>  contains info describing the system since boot time (who is logged in, what demons might be running)

*   /sbin           =>  system essential files similar to the bin dir.
*   programs in sbin were statically linked and thus had rewer library dependencies
*   in modern distro it's symbolically linked to /usr/sbin

*   /srv            =>  used as a folder for files served by a web server or other server mechanism (ftp)

*   /sys            =>  info about devices, drivers, kernel features running on the system
*   like /proc but better structured
*   used with /proc in system admin to pull info about the system

*   /tmp            =>  directory for temporary files
*   used to store things we don't intend to keep beyond the next reboot

*   /usr            =>  contains most of the programs and utilities the system will run
*   shared between al users and readonly except for the root

*   /var            =>  the system specific variable files (logs, temporary message files, spool files)
*   web servers place their files here      =>  /var/www    -->>    apache
